# Eli_Faulk


I'm currently a sophomore at Littleton High School and am enrolled in the Computer Science pathway at Epic Campus. 


I have experience coding in Python and C#. I've received my PCEP certification for entry-level Python programming. I also gained my experience in C# by using online sources to teach myself in order to make independent projects in the Unity game engine for personal use or for school competitions (Technology Student Association and the STEM Program). 

I also have branched out into more areas related to creative arts. I have been teaching myself how to make both digital art (including pixel art) and traditional art (mainly with pen and pencil, though I have experimented with markers, watercolor, and acrylic paint). I enjoy hands-on creative activities, and making stories and new worlds for others to enjoy and explore.
